# React (Vite) Weather App: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the 10-phase implementation plan for developing the React (Vite) weather application frontend.

### Phase 1: Project Cleanup and Layout
- Standardize the project folder structure (e.g., merge `Component` and `components`).
- Create a main layout component (`Layout.jsx`) that includes a header and a footer/main container.
- Configure `react-router-dom` for the primary pages: Home (`/`), Location (`/location/:city`), and Settings (`/settings`).

### Phase 2: Home Page UI - Current Weather
- Create the `CurrentWeatherCard` component.
- Use static/mock data from `structure.md` to populate the card.
- Style the card using Tailwind CSS, including support for the existing dark mode functionality.
- Create the `SearchBar` component UI (functionality to be added in a later phase).
- Integrate these new components into the Home page.

### Phase 3: Home Page UI - Forecasts
- Refactor the existing `HourlyTimeline.jsx` component to align with the new design and data models.
- Create the `WeeklyForecast` component UI.
- Populate both forecast components with mock data.
- Add these components to the Home page.

### Phase 4: API Integration and Data Fetching
- Identify and get credentials for a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, Tomorrow.io).
- Create a service module (`src/services/weatherService.js`) to encapsulate API calls.
- Implement functions to fetch current weather, hourly forecast, and daily forecast based on a location.
- Replace all mock data on the Home page with live data fetched from the API for a default location.

### Phase 5: Search and Routing Functionality
- Implement the logic for the `SearchBar` component to capture user input.
- When the user searches, use the weather service to find the location.
- Navigate the user to the `/location/:city` page using `react-router-dom`.
- Ensure the Location page fetches and displays the correct data for the city in the URL.

### Phase 6: State Management for Settings
- Create a React Context (`src/context/SettingsContext.jsx`) to manage global settings (units, language, theme).
- Implement logic within the context provider to persist settings to `localStorage`.
- Wrap the entire application in the `SettingsProvider` in `main.jsx`.

### Phase 7: Building the Settings Page
- Build the UI for the Settings page (`/settings`).
- Create the `UnitSelector`, `LanguageSelector`, and `ThemeSwitcher` components.
- Connect these components to the `SettingsContext` to read and update global settings.
- Verify that changing a setting (e.g., theme or temperature unit) is reflected across the application.

### Phase 8: Advanced UI and Theming
- Ensure all components correctly adapt to the theme setting from the `SettingsContext`.
- Use Tailwind's `dark:` variant consistently across all new and existing components.
- Refine colors, transitions, and styles for both light and dark modes to ensure a polished and consistent user experience.

### Phase 9: Location Management
- Implement the `LocationManager` component on the Settings page.
- This component will allow users to add the currently viewed location to a list of saved locations.
- It will also allow users to view, select, or delete locations from their saved list.
- Store the saved locations list in `localStorage` via the `SettingsContext`.

### Phase 10: Final Touches and Deployment Prep
- Implement loading and error states for all data-fetching operations to improve user feedback.
- Conduct a full review of the UI for responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Ensure basic accessibility standards are met (e.g., ARIA labels, semantic HTML).
- Clean up the codebase, remove console logs, and write a `README.md` with setup and run instructions.
